This app was created on Android Studios to convert currencies from different countries. The purpose is to help people practice and learn currency conversions easily, and to streamline the conversion process abroad -- especially in places without internet access or web browers.

There is a game (game.java) and a calculator (calculator.java).

The game gives you the option to choose two countries to convert and the computer will generate a random number. The player will type in a number guess/calculation for the correct conversion of that number for the countries chosen. If the number submitted is valid and within the margin of error (5), you win. If you are too low or too high, the computer will ask you to guess again.

The calculator lets you choose two countries and you can input the amount you would like to convert.
